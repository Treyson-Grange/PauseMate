# PauseMate

I'm writing this now because I will forget because it's late, but this does seem like a fun, useful project

## Project Description

Pause mate is a CLI that users will throw on in the background, and recieve push notifications and little sounds, to remind them to do certain things that will help them take care of themselves.

- Notifications using beeep
- cute design
- cli functionlity to pass -c <"message"> \<interval in min\>
- json config files to store notifications and encouragements
- muteable (turn off sounds) (i didnt know what mutable meant 2 seconds after i wrote it)
- no bubble tea this time! I don't need it.
-

## Roadmap

- [x] System to read in json file(s)
- [x] Get notification objects based on json
- [x] Get system to coundown time (should be like a defer probably)
- [x] System to notify
- [ ] Get assets (cute pictures, sounds)
- [ ] System to play sounds on notify. (needs assets)
- [x] function to get user input for creation.
- [x] function to edit the json file
- [x] "create" -c to create notifications.
- [x] create function.
- [ ] UI
- [ ] Test files
- [ ] Heres an idea. On start, it has you rate your day so far, and based on these numbers, we change stuff. IDK specififcs but keep it in
